# Cryptocurrency Trading Platform

This project is a Java Spring-based cryptocurrency trading platform that enables users to sign up, log in, and execute cryptocurrency transactions. It employs JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication, with user data stored in a MySQL database. Real-time cryptocurrency market data is seamlessly integrated from the Gecko API. This repository focuses on user management, while the crypto-marketplace project functions as a microservice, responsible for fetching cryptocurrency data and handling order processing.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login using JWT.
- **Real-Time Coin Data:** Integrated with the Gecko API to fetch live cryptocurrency market data.
- **Portfolio Management:** Completed orders are added to the userâ€™s portfolio, allowing them to track and manage their cryptocurrency assets.
- **Kafka Integration:** Real-time data updates using Kafka for market information.

In development
- **Order Execution:** Users can place buy orders, which are added to a market and executed when matching buy/sell orders are found.
