# Cryptocurrency Trading Platform

A Java Spring-based cryptocurrency trading platform that allows users to sign up, log in, and place orders for cryptocurrency transactions. The system uses JWT for secure authentication, stores user data in a MySQL database, and integrates real-time cryptocurrency data fetched from the Gecko API.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login using JWT.
- **Real-Time Coin Data:** Integrated with the Gecko API to fetch live cryptocurrency market data.
- **Portfolio Management:** Completed orders are added to the userâ€™s portfolio, allowing them to track and manage their cryptocurrency assets.
- **Kafka Integration:** Real-time data updates using Kafka for market information.

In development
- **Order Execution:** Users can place buy orders, which are added to a market and executed when matching buy/sell orders are found.
